                The food options and responsibilities to consider are organised and more efficient. Online menus with photographs of the 
                meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional 
                choices which is already provided by St. Xaver's School. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen are provided 
                with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements 
                they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online eliminates all the fuss of money handling, making it 
                safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

                1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. 
                <br>
                2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                <br> 
                3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
